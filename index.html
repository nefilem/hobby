                    Eyup, Keiron here, been a developer for over 20 years using everything from 68000 on the Amiga (many many years ago) through to Delphi and VB6 then onto a little bit of c#, typescript, vb.net etc... in the last few years (before I was made redundant!) I did have a brief stint in back end web development back in the year 2000 (ish) and the web developer bootcamp is hopefully going to give me the confidence to get back into web development but this time maybe the front end rather than back (or a bit of both?) Aside from this I also do a bit of Archaeology from time to time, a bit of acting and also photography and videography!
